INTRO TO P5 - Main Functions:
[ function setup() ] - the setup function runs once when you first start the program. It (normally) always includes the createCanvas() function which takes three parameters which are the width, height and the renderer. For example a canvas which is 400px by 300px would be written as createCanvas(400,300);

[ function draw() ] - the draw function attempts to run 60 times a second. This works similar to the way update/draw functions work in OpenFrameworks and Processing.

ellipse(x,y,width,height) - displays ellipse

fill(colorValue) - fills shapes with a certain color
stroke(colorValue) - fills the line of shapes with a certain color
noFill() - removes the fill color (makes transparent)
